# Odd or Even, revisited

## Problem Description
Earlier in this class, you wrote a program to check if a number is odd or even. This is a variation of that program - this time using a function.

* Write a function that tests whether a number is odd or even. 


## Example
```
Input: 5
odd

Input: 12
even
```

## Suggested Approach
1) Start by writing your function. Be sure to follow the notes in the starter code about required formatting.
2) Feel free to go back and review your previous assignment if needed.
3) Your function should contain a parameter for the input number, such that an argument can be passed into the function when it is called.

## Hints
* Use `input()` to prompt the user for a value. 
* Be careful about variable types.

Run your code with: `python my_code.py`

Run your tests with: `pytest`
